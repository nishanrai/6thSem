# CSITauthority 6th Sem Contents

All 6thSem specific contents of CSITauthority under one repository

## Website

Website is generated from this code, at gh-pages branch: [https://csitauthority.github.io/6thSem][1]

## To Contribute //for Developers

1. `git clone https://github.com/csitauthority/6thSem.git`
2. `cd 6thSem`
3. `git submodule init`
4. `git submodule update --remote`
5. `hugo server --ignoreCache`

&ast; _We assume that you have already installed [git-bash][100] and [hugo][101]. Keep `hugo.exe` inside `C:\Users\{Username}\bin\` after installing git-bash. Oh, and you also(___ofcourse___) need a github account_

Executing these commands will let you have a local copy of [`CSITauthority/6thSem`][1], for making desired changes, which you can then send us via a pull-request to incorporate into the main repository.

> To change how the site looks and functions, you should contribute towards [the theme repo][2] instead.

We __strongly__ recommend you to fork your _own copy_ of this repository before doing anything. That will replace your URL from Step-1 into (say) `https://github.com/siddhantrimal/6thSem.git` , with your username replacing `siddhantrimal`. By doing so, it will be easier to send your updates.

### Or, you can just upload 
If development is not for you(yet?ever?), you can still easily contribute by [joining our slack][3].
